            Caleb Chase is a 22 year old interdisciplinary artist living in Boston who recently graduated from Studio for Interrelated Media at MassArt. He makes music for recordings and performances in bands, alone, and scores for other performers. Additionally, he makes sound work that exists outside the scope of traditional sonic experiences, often combining an auditory element with other traditional art media such as, paintings, installations, or sculptures. Through this he hopes to examine the structures that surround music and how it exists in relationship to technology, culture and ideology beyond its existence as a vibration on the ear drum.

            From Sea Cliff New York, studying studio art/music at Bard College.
            <br/>
            <br />
            Has been working towards ways of asserting art as a deep socially productive container and sound as a medium for communication. Working towards a collaborative practice that involves interactive sculpture, testimonies, and new contexts for listening. Having performed for years in Brooklyn and around the eastern half of the U.S. work has become informed by d.i.y. art and activist communities and ways of making spaces for participation. Various projects with radio transmission, tape loops, analog video, and body-as-circuit situations have led to sounding buckets, and electromagnetic fields as a new variable architecture for simultaneous listening and movement.

            Kirsten Carey is a guitarist, composer, and performer living in Detroit, MI. Carey's work seeks to unite ideas across genres and disciplines, as seen in her much-lauded Ulysses Project, a performative song cycle about James Joyce's Ulysses praised as "ten tracks of avant-garde eclecticism perfectly in the mood of the novel" (Alterego Magazine). She also leads Throwaway, an art punk duo dominated by a strange woman in a paper bag mask, with all the "aerodynamic-rock-grit flavors of the likes of Primus or Deerhoof" (Current Magazine). Carey was asked by Elliott Sharp to contribute her piece "Sasquatch / Happening" to Clean Feed Record's I Never Meta Guitar III in 2015. She has been featured on the blog Prepared Guitar and shared the stage with the likes of Elliott Sharp, Weasel Walter, Andrew Bishop, and Thollem McDonas.
