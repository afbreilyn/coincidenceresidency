              Sarah Ayotomiwa Pitan
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sarah Pitan is a young American artist. She is a first-generation Nigerian-American who was born in raised in Boston. She has backgrounds in sports, dance, and visual arts, all of which indirectly inform her current artistic work. Her education in piano performance and music composition at the Rivers School Conservatory and the Boston Conservatory directly inform her work. However, her current practice involves an intensive conceptual abstraction from the aforementioned disciplines, which are under attack. She refers to her work as manipulative, improvisational, accelerative, or abductive writing. In this way, Pitan experiments with concepts originating in post-Kantian ontology. Along with this, concepts developed in formal logic, set theory, and minimalism influence her work. The bulk of Pitan’s work exists in writing : notes, transcriptions, and scores. Her work attempts to deterritorialize the stage and reappropriate a critical method of performance. She currently resides in Brooklyn.
