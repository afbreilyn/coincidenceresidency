          Fill out your application here. We are most interested in your project proposal for the festival. Our main advice is: think big, think radical, and be idealistic. Your portfolio functions as supplementary material that will give us a better chance to get to know you as an artist.

            In lieu of any specific 'project proposal', we would like to ask for a short written response to the following prompt. This will, we hope, give you a clearer sense of the concepts we'll be working with (and expanding from) at co-incidence, while also allowing us to see how they may fit into your practice.

          </p>
          <p class="text-faded small-text">
            Please write a response to any the below concepts. Consider how they relate to your work and what you may bring / develop / discuss / perform at the Festival. Your response may take any form that you feel is appropriate: a score, a draft of a score, a poem, a short essay, a stream-of-consciousness response, a partial piece to-be-developed/realized, etc. It can be as long as you'd like, but please consider keeping it somewhat short (perhaps 1-2 pages, loosely). As a further means of contextualizing the prompt, we have prepared some brief remarks on each concept:
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded small-text">
              - the bridge :: a unit of basic linkage. two sides. a relationship formed, worked on, built together.
              <br />
              - the swarm :: a link between living entities forming something like a moving body. a flock. a certain awareness of and responsiveness to energy within the group.
              <br />
              - social sculpture :: the idea of consciousness creating a field in which linking, bridging, and swarming processes are possible. an ideal state of sorts. a vibrancy and absence of ego.
