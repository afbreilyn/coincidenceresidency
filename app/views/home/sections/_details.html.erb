          While most of this will be determined by the Artists, we do have a few 'fixed points' during the residency. Namely, three performances at Washington Street Gallery:

          This will feature (six) solo pieces/sets by all of the co-incidence Guest Artists. While we will get to know one another, and the local community, through other means throughout the residency, this provides a uniquely personal way to understand and be in contact with the co-incidence artists.

          This show will last from sunrise until completion and feature new works by the Guest Artists and Resident Artist, performed by the co-incidence ensemble (Guest Artists and Resident Artist, and Directors). These works will have been workshopped and critiqued throughout the week. Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner will be provided at Washington Street Gallery during the show.

          In addition to these events, the co-incidence artists will be at Washington Street Gallery morning, afternoon, and evening, rehearsing works and discussing relevant (or not) topics together. All of this, with the exception of the performances, provides a flexible framework that can be altered during the residency by the artists as they (we) see fit.

          High quality audio recordings and live sound for each concert will be run by Ernst Karel. Video recording and photographs will be run by Non-Event and co-incidence directors.
