        <p>
          Over coffee in Maine in the Summer of 2015, Luke and Aaron had a far too grandiose idea: "let's do our own music festival!" (Un)fortunately, they don't know when to stop. And here we are, with co-incidence, an experimental music residency kicking off it's first season in January 2017. We wanted to fill a perceived gap in support for experimental composer/performers in the U.S. with a music festival/residency focused on experimental music and built as an experimental composer might built a piece.
