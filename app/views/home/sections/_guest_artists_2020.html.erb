        website: "http://robertblatt.ricercata.org/",
        description: "Robert Blatt (b. 1984 in Anaheim, CA) creates work rooted in explorations of expanded sonic situations through varying frames and gradations of environment, notation, object, performance, text and tone. The notion of a site-responsive practice and scores in their exhaustive sense make a regular appearance in his work, often dissolving aspects of language, location, material and presence as vehicles for an unspecified or autonomous encounter with the ambiguities of the work itself. His work has been presented in the context of performances, exhibitions, readings, publications and a variety of hard-to-pin-down occurrences and has been supported through a fellowship from Akademie Schloss Solitude (DE) and residencies from Initiative for Digital Exploration of Arts and Sciences (CA), Jack Straw Cultural Center (WA) and GEMAK (NL). He co-founded/directed the Miami-based Inlets Foundation for Experimental Practices and the international experimental music/performance art collective Acid Police Noise Ensemble."

        website: "http://www.heimart.at/index.php/joachim-eckl.html",
        description: "Joachim Eckl was born and brought up in 1962 in Haslach, Austria. The relation to his country and culture as well as the local particularities became important for Eckl after he returned from studying in New York in 1989. His commitment and work is based on the conviction and knowledge that the achievements of the 20th century entailed progress but also an immoderate carelessness: for Eckl, the time has come to return something to the river and the region. After his studies of psychology in Austria and New York, Eckl has worked for over 20 years in various positions and roles in the art world. In parallel to the realization of over 100 of his own projects, he was part of the implementation of the large-scale projects of Tony Cragg, Jeff Koons, Christo & Jean Claude, and Klaus Rinke. Eckl currently works as a freelance artist under the label HEIM.ART® in “Der Station—Neufelden” and as part of international projects. Run by Eckl, “Die Station—Neufelden”, the former warehouse on the Große Mühl, has been used as an art space for over 10 years. In the years 2008—2009, he realized projects in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Great Britain, Egypt, Zambia, and Zimbabwe."

Through audio-visual installation and interdisciplinary collaborations, her multi-sensory work often explores social connection through audience participation. She believes that sharing the creative process with others empowers a communal form of artistic ownership and challenges the notion of a singular artistic genius."

His improvisational work centers around approaching the drum as a site of resonance and employing various techniques and preparations to achieve an extensive timbral palette. He also works with found objects, zither, contact mics, analog electronics, and field recordings. In addition, he is an interpreter of experimental works for and with percussion. As a composer, his practice is rooted in a concern for deep listening, communitarian ritual, and the subjective psychological engagements with the unique characteristics and qualities of our physical, social, and sonic environments."
